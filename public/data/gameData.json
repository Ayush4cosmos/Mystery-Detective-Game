  "story": "On a rainy midnight, the affluent art collector Mr. Hawthorne hosted a private unveiling in his opulent mansion. The main exhibit—a priceless renaissance dagger—was enshrined in a glass case at the center of the grand gallery. As the clock chimed 11:47 PM, the lights flickered, and guests gasped: the dagger was gone, and Mr. Hawthorne lay unconscious on the marble floor, a single drop of rare blue ink staining his shirt cuff. The power was out for exactly 37 seconds.\n\nAmidst the thunder, one guest quietly slipped away. Only subtle details will expose the culprit.",

  "solution": {
    "culprit": "Suspect 5",
    "weapon": "Cyanide (disguised as restoration solvent)",
    "place": "Grand Gallery (just beneath the dagger casing)",
    "explanation": "Suspect 5, an art restoration expert, intentionally disabled the gallery lighting using a rare solvent circuit breaker trick (causing 37‑sec blackout), swapped the dagger using the eerily similar restoration solvent container, and slipped the dagger sheath into their coat. The blue ink was residue from their solvent pen. They intended to poison Mr. Hawthorne with cyanide but panicked, causing the dagger theft instead. Every clue — ink stains, lavender glove scent, hourglass, mud, sheath — connects to Suspect 5’s profession and actions."
