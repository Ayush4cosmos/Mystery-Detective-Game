  "story": "On a stormy autumn night, the sprawling Langford Estate was alive with laughter, music, and the clinking of glasses. Gregory Langford, an influential but controversial art collector, was hosting a private gala to unveil a newly acquired painting rumored to be a lost work of Caravaggio. Among the elite guests were artists, investors, and rivals, each with their own hidden reasons for being there.\n\nAs lightning flickered across the stained-glass windows of the Art Vault, Gregory was found dead \u2014 face down in his wine glass at the head of the long oak dining table. Panic ensued. The doors had been locked. No one had entered or left since dinner began.\n\nWhispers of sabotage, jealousy, and decades-old grudges filled the marble halls. The painting itself had vanished. Gregory\u2019s last words, scribbled in a corner of his guestbook, read only: 'The mask slips tonight.'\n\nFour detectives \u2014 each with unique talents \u2014 have been brought in to interrogate the guests and uncover what really happened inside the Langford Estate. But with misleading alibis, staged scenes, and overlapping motives, this case may prove as layered as the stolen painting itself.",

The traces of cyanide and Omar\u2019s suspicious behavior when asked about toxicology were key.\n\nThough other suspects had motives \u2014 Isabelle\u2019s humiliation, Victor\u2019s inheritance, Celeste\u2019s dispute \u2014 only Omar had the means, opportunity, and a calculated motive that tied into both the financial and physical evidence. The fingerprint on the cork and his panicked inquiry about chemical traces confirmed his guilt. His emotional state, while visibly shaken, masked deep fear and urgency rather than grief."
